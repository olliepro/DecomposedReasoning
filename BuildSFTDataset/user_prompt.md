## Text to transform:

Do your best to replace steering phrases in the execution blocks so they don't repeat the steering command. For example, common words like "Wait", "but", "alternatively", should sometimes be replaced to instead make their sentences flow like a conversation from the latest steering command. Keep even incoherent and messy text unless isolating it to the steering section (this is the only time you can reduce redundancy). I will check that the stream of conscience's entire journey is intact and nothing is left behind. I expect a long XML code block. Do not merely summarize what happens in execution blocks, but truly write the steering as if you were writing it for the first time.
